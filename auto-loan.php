<h2>Flexible Auto Loan</h2>
<p>If it seems like you need to be a world class negotiator these days to buy a new car, van or truck, you’re not alone. That’s why many smart new car buyers are turning to pre-approved financing. With a pre-approved auto loan from Groningenbank, buying the new or used vehicle you want can be quick and easy. That’s because we “pre-approve” you for the amount you need, before you visit the dealership. And there’s absolutely no obligation to buy a vehicle or take the loan. With a Groningenbank Auto Loan, dealers will view you as a cash customer and you’ll be in a much better bargaining position. You’ll have the ability to negotiate a better vehicle price and, in most cases, drive away the same day. Here’s how to get started:</p>
<p>1. Apply for pre-approval with our <a href="online-banking/apply-loan">Secure Online Loan Application</a>, or call your local branch. We’ll get back to you right away with the answer you need.</p>
<p>2. Call or visit a local auto dealer to get a price quote on the vehicle you want. Of course you’ll want to let the dealer know that you’ll be financing your vehicle with us, AFTER you’ve made your best deal.</p>
<p>3. With a Groningenbank Auto Loan, you’ll get reasonable rates and a flexible repayment plan. We’ll also help you figure out what financing program is right for you. * APR is based on a $25,000 loan amount, 6-year loan term, loan fee of $159, and automatic payment from a Groningenbank account.  Loan approval subject to the bank’s underwriting requirements. Loan terms and conditions are subject to change without notice.  Must be a new loan with Groningenbank.</p>
