                            <h2>Flexible Home Equity Loan</h2>
                            <p>With a Groningenbank Home Equity Loan you might be able to save money on our special low, locked-in interest rate that could be 100% tax-deductible (consult your tax advisor). You’ll enjoy the convenience of affordable monthly payments over a fixed time period and you might be able to save even more by paying off higher interest obligations such as department store charges.

                            </p>

                            <p>You can apply for a home equity loan online, by phone or in person. You should be prepared to provide an estimate of your home’s value as well as other supporting documents.</p>

                            <p>Interest on a home equity loan may be tax deductible. Consult your tax advisor regarding tax deductibility.</p>

                            <p>The amount of equity you have in your home is determined by the value of your home minus the amount you owe on your mortgage. The loan amount depends on several factors like your income, credit history and the market value of your home. Typically, you can borrow 80% of the equity in your home.
                            </p>

                            <p>A home equity loan is a type of second mortgage. It’s similar to a traditional mortgage in that you take out a predetermined amount at a fixed interest rate. Once you receive the money, you’re expected to start paying it back in monthly installments, based on a set schedule.

                            </p>
