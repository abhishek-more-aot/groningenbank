                            <h2>Who We are</h2>
                            <p>Groningenbank is a personal and business bank with a mission. For 10 years, we have been dedicated to working with our customers, members and partners to create a future-proof society that can overcome important social challenges. Our starting point has always been that together we can achieve more than we can alone.</p>

                            <h2>Mission & Strategy</h2>
                            <p>Our ambition is to be the most customer-oriented bank in the Netherlands and worldwide. Groningenbank is committed to making the difference as a leading, business, personal, customer-oriented bank locally through Banking for the Netherlands and worldwide. In doing so we opt for excellent customer focus and aim for a '9+ customer experience. Through our local Groningenbank we are moving more nearby our customers in every way: physically (through customer meetings and networks), virtually (through apps and websites) and mentally (through involvement). In achieving this, the local Groningenbank will be able to rely 100% on the support of an extremely well-organised banking business in which innovation, fast procedures and ready-to-use knowledge will ensure there is once again ample room for our cooperative customer service.</p>

                            <p>Groningenbank feels a strong connection with her customers and members and consequently also with the future of the Netherlands. We prosper when our customers prosper. We can distinguish ourselves as a cooperative bank by making a targeted contribution to meeting the challenges the Netherlands will face in the years ahead. This constitutes an investment in sustainable welfare and prosperity in the Netherlands. We strengthen the Netherlands of the future through Banking for the Netherlands.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                            <p>Our goals are to create and maintain long-term working relationships with our customers, to contribute to our community by helping local businesses grow, and to support good causes that improve the quality of life for all.
                            </p>
